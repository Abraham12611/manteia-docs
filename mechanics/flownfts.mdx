## Definition

A **FlowNFT** is a standard ERC-721 token that represents a legal and technical claim on a future revenue stream. Unlike static NFTs (art, collectibles), a FlowNFT is a **dynamic financial instrument** with intrinsic value derived from cash flow.

## The Asset Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Minting">
    The borrower (founder) connects their data source (Stripe/Shopify). The Manteia client generates a ZK Proof of their historical revenue and solvency.
    
    Upon verification of the proof on-chain, the `ManteiaFactory` contract mints a **FlowNFT**. This NFT contains metadata regarding the loan terms (Amount, Rate, Duration) but *excludes* sensitive business data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Funding">
    The FlowNFT is instantly offered to the **Lending Vault**. If the loan fits the vault's risk parameters (checked against the ZK proof's output score), the Vault purchases the NFT.
    
    *   **Result**: The NFT is transferred to the Vault. USDC is transferred to the Borrower.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Repayment (Streaming)">
    The borrower configures a **Smart Split** (based on `0xSplits`). A percentage of their daily revenue is automatically routed to the Manteia Repayment contract.
    
    As funds arrive, they are attributed to the FlowNFT. The Lending Vault (the holder) claims these funds + yield.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Burning / Maturity">
    Once the total repayment amount (Principal + Fee) is reached, the FlowNFT is considered **Matured**. It can be burned or archived as a "Certificate of Creditworthiness" for future loans.
  </Step>
</Steps>
