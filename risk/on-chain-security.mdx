## Smart Contract Architecture

Manteia is "Built on Math" and enforced by immutable code.

*   **`Verifier.sol`**: An auto-generated contract from Circom/SnarkJS. It contains the verification key for the ZK circuit. It is mathematically impossible to forge a valid proof without valid input data.
*   **`LendingVault.sol`**: Holds all un-lent capital. It adheres to the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
*   **`FlowNFT.sol`**: Standard ERC-721 implementation with restricted minting rights (only the `ManteiaFactory` can mint).

## Audits

*(Note: Manteia is currently in Beta. Audit reports will be posted here upon completion.)*

## Emergency Pausing

To protect lender funds in the event of a black swan or discovered vulnerability, the **Manteia DAO Security Council** holds a 2/3 multisig capability to:
1.  Pause new minting (borrowing).
2.  Pause withdrawals (in extreme bank run scenarios).
3.  Upgrade the `Verifier` contract (if a new ZK vulnerability is found).

The DAO cannot confiscate funds or seize FlowNFTs arbitrarily.
