## The Problem with Traditional Finance

Digital businesses (SaaS, Newsletters, Creators) have predictable monthly revenue but no physical assets (factories, real estate) to use as collateral.

*   **Banks** don't understand API-based revenue.
*   **VCs** demand equity (ownership) for capital.
*   **Fintech Lenders** require intrusive data access and manual underwriting.

## The Manteia Solution

Manteia builds a bridge between on-chain liquidity and off-chain reputation, without compromising privacy.

| Feature | Manteia | Banks | VC | Fintech Lenders |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Collateral** | Revenue History (ZK Verified) | Physical Assets | Equity | Revenue History |
| **Speed** | Instant (Programmatic) | Months | Months | Days/Weeks |
| **Cost** | Competitive APY | Low APY + Fees | Equity (Most Expensive) | High APR |
| **Privacy** | **Zero-Knowledge** | Full Disclosure | Full Disclosure | Full Data Access |
| **Ownership** | **100% Yours** | 100% Yours | Diluted | 100% Yours |

## Comparison to RWAs

Most Real-World Asset (RWA) protocols focus on tokenizing T-Bills or Real Estate. Manteia focuses on **Corporate Cash Flow**.

*   **Others**: Tokenize static assets (Gold, Real Estate).
*   **Manteia**: Tokenizes *velocity* (Revenue Streams).

By using Zero-Knowledge proofs, Manteia is the first protocol to make private financial data usable on public blockchains without doxxing the borrower.
